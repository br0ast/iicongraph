# IICONGRAPH
This repository contains the documentation about the data model and development process of IICONGRAPH.

## Requirements

[Python 3.8.10](https://www.python.org/) must be installed in your machine. Either [Blazegraph](https://blazegraph.com/) or [GraphDB](https://graphdb.ontotext.com/) must also be installed. [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/) must also be installed (either normal version or [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/install)). Please refer to the corresponding documentations to install these softwares/programming language.

### Python requirements

You can install the requirements by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Data Model

IICONGRAPH mainly uses the [ICON ontology](#1) as its schema. ICON is an ontology developed to describe artistic interpretation according to the metholodology of [Panofsky](#2). According to Panofsky, an interpretation can be divided into three communicating levels. On the first level, named preiconographical, you associate actions, expressional qualities and natural elements (like a tree, dog, sword) with artworks by recognizing them as artistic motifs. Meanwhile the natural elements, expressional qualities and actions are universal, the artistic motifs are the representation of those universal concepts in a painting. I.e., you state that there is an horse (concept) in Guernica (artwork) because you recognize that there is an artistic motif which resembles the concept of horse. In other words, two different painting may share the same natural element but they do not share the artistic motifs which represent it. You can also recognized sets of artistic motifs (artistic motif of woman + artistic motif of sadness) together in a composition. On the second level, named iconographical, you associate Characters, Events, Named Objects (Thor's Hammer), Symbols, Personifications, Places (Rome, if you recognize a general "city" that would be a natural element) with an artwork by the recognition of images. Images work in the same way as artistic motif, the "Character" is universal, the "image" is the representation of that character in that specific artwork. When you do an iconographical recognition, you can also refer to a previous pre-iconographical recognition. (i.e, you recognize that the Image of Athena in this painting is associated with the artistic motif of a woman that you recognize in a pre-iconographical level. This is important because you could recognize Zeus as a character and then refer to the artistic motif of a Bull as Zeus is sometimes depicted as a Bull). Symbols are expressed by following the [Simulation Ontology](#3), as in HyperReal (described below). In this ontology, a Simulation is the link between a symbol (also called Simulacrum), its symbolic meaning (also called Reality Counterpart) and the cultural context in which the symbol symbolizes the symbolic meaning. In this level you can also recognize stories and allegories, which are sets of all the iconographical elements named above (Characters, events, etc...). On the third level, named iconological, you associate abstract concepts or cultural phenomenon in artworks via the recognition of its intrinsic meaning. The intrinsic meaning can be connected to previously recognized images and/or artistic motifs to support the claim.

Table 1 below summarizes the ICON and Simulation Ontology classes (plus classes from other ontologies they reuse) used in IICONGRAPH and Table 2 summerizes the object properties used (from ICON, Simulation Ontology, and other ontologies that are reused in them).

| https://w3id.org/icon/ontology/Image                          | Image   is a reification class linking the identified second level subject (namely:   Characters, Events, Places, Named Objects, Symbols and Personifications) to   the specific interpretation that recognizes it. It represents the subject   depicted as a manifestation in the specific artwork taken into account, in   contrast to the second level subjects cited and Invenzione, identifying   iconographies from an abstract and general point of view. This distinction   between the general subject level and the artwork-specific one is functional   to identify the variants of a subject in relation to the specific   context.  |                        |

It differs from   the first level Action since it requires deeper interpretation to be   identified. For example, the act of hurling the Trident (Action) held by   Neptune in some iconographies is interpreted as the act of calming the storm   (Event) provoked by Juno in Virgil's Aeneid book 1. Furthermore, an Event is   linked to a icon:Image, and not to a icon:Artistic Motif. This class includes   also events having a proper identity, such as historical events (e.g. the   Battle of Cascina).                                                             |                        |

The compositional principles concerning the human body representation, such   as the contrapposto, are considered as Qualities as well, since they can be   interpreted as poses assumed by the human figure. Every specification of the   element (e.g. NaturalElement, Action) described, such as color, position,   age, may be described as quality.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                        |

## Sources

### Wikidata

[Wikidata](#4) is a collaborative knowledge base containing information about a wide range of domains. We are interested in the [painting](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3305213) domain, and we converted the statements that linked paintings to the elements they [depict](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P180).

### ArCo

[ArCo](#5) is the Italian cultural heritage knowledge graph. We are interested in all the [Historic or Artistic properties](https://w3id.org/arco/ontology/arco/HistoricOrArtisticProperty) that have a textual description following the "Iconographic Reading" syntax (such as [this](https://dati.beniculturali.it/lodview-arco/resource/HistoricOrArtisticProperty/0500668520.html)).

The description is in Italian, and, as seen in the scripts, an automatic translation is necessary before the conversion.

### HyperReal

[HyperReal](#3) a knowledge graph of cultural symbolism. It is used in the context of IICONGRAPH to generate automatic potential symbolic interpretation. Imagine a painting depicts an apple, and an apple in HyperReal is the symbol of the original sin from a Christian point of view. The painting depicting an apple can be automatically interpreted as symbolizing the original sin. These interpretations are **creator-agnostic** and just **potential**, and should be used as a starting point for art historian to analyse the symbolism behind artworks.

## Data conversion

### Wikidata

For the data conversion of Wikidata, please refer to the jupyter notebook [ICONGRAPHwikidatadocs.ipynb](ICONGRAPHwikidatadocs.ipynb)

### ArCo

For the data conversion of ArCo, please refer to the jupyter notebook [ICONGRAPHarcodocs.ipynb](ICONGRAPHarcodocs.ipynb)

### Combining the data

The released version of IICONGRAPH is the combined version created by exporting function of GraphDB after loading both IICONGRAPHarco and IICONGRAPHwikidata in the same instance.

The same result can be obtained in Python by using the library rdflib in the following code

```python
    from rdflib import Graph
    g1 = Graph()
    g2 = Graph()
    g1.parse("path_to_iicongrapharco")
    g2.parse("path_to_iicongraphwikidata")
    combined_graph = Graph()
    combined_graph = g1 + g2
    combined_graph.serialize(destination="namefile.ttl", format="ttl")
    # Considering the size of the graphs, it might take a while for rdflib
    #to combine them
```
